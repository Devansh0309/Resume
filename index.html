                </li>
            <li>Did some work on integer partitions and wrote a paper on representing unordered integer partitions of k-parts in which 
                number of integer partitions of k-parts are calculated from these representations. My paper contains representations 
                only up to k=3 starting from 2. It is published in <cite>Global Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics, Volume 15 No. 
                6:889-907, DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.15248.35846. Oct.2019</cite></li>
